* [getSensorData](https://github.com/ramonayag/sensor-data-collection/blob/main/getSensorData.ino)
  * Getting data from multiple sensors to determine best sensor to detect nearby movement, specifically falling 

Testing 
* Check proper connection of components and sensors 
* Connect Arduino Nano to computer via USB 
* Upload getSensorData.ino to Nano 
* In terminal cd to location of read-serial.py
* Run script read-serial.py
